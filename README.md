# Bit-Representations

BitSet Representations
This C program is a simple implementation of a bit set, a data structure that allows for efficient manipulation of bits. It uses an unsigned short (16 bits) to represent the bit set. 
The program provides functions to create:
- a bit set
- set or clear a specific bit
- get the value of a specific bit
- display the bit set.

Twoâ€™s Compliment
This C program is designed to handle binary integers. It provides two main functionalities:
1) Converting a binary string representation of an integer into an int data type.
2) Displaying the bit representation of an int data type.

Floating Point
This C program is designed to handle binary floating-point numbers. It provides two main functionalities:
1) Converting a binary string representation of a floating-point number into a float data type.
2) Displaying the bit representation of a float data type.
